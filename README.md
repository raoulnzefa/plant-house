## Description

**Plant House** is an online shop project that offers to buy different plants and flowers. It has a collection of pages and related content that published with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The project has a responsive design which means that user will have a good accessibility from different devices.

I would like to implement new features like e-mail support ang page "Favourites" in the future. Because at this moment E-mail fields just exist :sweat_smile:

It created from scratch with Vue.js, Vuex and Vue Router.

This is my first project on Vue 3, namely with Composition API usage.
